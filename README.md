<p style="text-align: center;">Takes on .obj and returns the MST of it</p>

***

<br><br><br>

Uses Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph. 
Loads graph from vertices and edges from OBJ file

Outputs an OBJ

Before exporting OBJ from blender, select the mesh in edit mode and 'delete only face' (as this only takes edges and verts)
