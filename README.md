<br>

Uses Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph. 
Loads graph from vertices and edges from OBJ file

Outputs an OBJ

Before exporting OBJ from blender, select the mesh in edit mode and 'delete only face' (as this only takes edges and verts)


## Installation

_If you don't have the java runtime installed, download it here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/_
